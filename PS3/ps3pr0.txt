CS111 - Python Problem Set 3
Problem 0


1. I found it very interesting that something based on a bio-molecular scale such as
	DNA, RNA, enzymes, etc, can be used and use the same logic as computers
	in games such as tic-tac-toe and guessing games. Although it is funny to
	see the similarities, it's a bit disappointing (but also understandable)
	that simple things such as a move in tic-tac-toe takes about half an hour
	to move compared to the speed of a move that can be done in the game if
	it were to be implemented into a computer game or just on paper.

2. Similar to our homework problems, but not as complex, the problems solved by the 
	DNA computers use "logic gates", similar to our if-else statements and 
	branches, in order to determine the answer or conclusion, such as 
	if a human player/scientist came the closest in the identification game
	where the test tube would glow different colored flourescent signals.
