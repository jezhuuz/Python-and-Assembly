1. Not so much in a cardinal vs egocentric direction boundaries as the article talks about, but being a part of a bilingual family, I sometimes forget which Chinese word is for "left" and which is for "right". I tried to make a general rule to help me memorize the two words, but I often forget that as well. So I usually just guess and pick a direction to turn towards and walk to and my mom or dad would just correct me if I guessed wrong.

2. Artificial languages are similar to human ones, such as Guugu Yimithirr or English, in a sense that not everyone knows, understands them, or is common practice to others, but they can be learned and generally understood by those who are willing to be exposed and practice them. Human thought can be expressed through any language, especially artificial language. For example, Python and Picobot can be used to represent thought, logic, and problem solving, just as egocentric or cardinal directions can be used to represent problem solving (and in the case of the article, navigation). Language is all about symbols and representations that people learn to correlate with actions, things, or ideas; and this includes artificial languages.
