Problem 0


1.Error checking and error-handling are the most important ideas and steps in any project.
A major preventable factor would have been to set limits to the bits of data to observe
and prevent overflow errors. As the article mentioned, another big preventative step
is to have every part of a complex software system run its own thoroughly tested,
simulated, and debugged software to prevent software dependency and sharing bugged code.

2. I agree that software does not necessarily fail in the same sense as a mechanical system.
Software failures are often caused by logical errors that are often not thought of to 
be possible (such as the 64-bit format to a 16-bit format overflow error) and are not 
necessarily measured or calculated the same as things that lead to mechanical errors, like
mismeasurements, material quality, etc.
