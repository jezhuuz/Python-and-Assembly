Problem 0:

2) I agree with we "don't have to settle for models at all". 
Models can provide us with a basic understanding as the first stepping stool of further exploration and understanding. 
Models provide the first flexible "rules"/steps to start out with and give the opportunity of idea expansion or improvement. 
It is true that "Newtonian models were crude approximations of the truth", and those very models were the first ideas that
started the expansion of thought that later on lead to the atomic level understanding that improved from those models or proved previous models wrong.
Of course we don't have to settle for models, they may just provide a general, simple outline of the deeper truth and understanding.
However, that is not to say that models do not further or influence those steps towards deeper understanding and realization, either.
Overall, in the world of science, data, and technology one should never "settle" for anything at all, and as we see with the exponential growth of technology and innovation, "settling" for something in these fields is pretty impossible and counterproductive.
