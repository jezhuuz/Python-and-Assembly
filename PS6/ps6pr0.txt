1. In light of the reading, I argue that computational models can hurt society. There is no doubt that computational models 
can help society, however, I believe that computational models can hurt society as well by giving a sense of 
the financial market, for instance, having a strict pattern that society may view as the concrete truth.
Especially in the financial market, patterns do occur and can be predicted based on past events, however, often times 
the market does not behave normally, and many surprising, unsuspecting crashes occur due to world events or other non-predictable 
things. Computational models can give a good idea of risk predictions and predictions of the future, but especially when it 
comes to climate change, global warming, pollution, and how our world and weather is progressing throughout the years and how
our world would look like in the future, computational models can ironically do the opposite of warn people and push them 
to change their behavior. With far away predictions like how our temperatures will be like in 2047, computational models
can cause a false sense of stability, and may even cause people to not take actions and reduce their pollution and emission
levels just because it seems like such a far away date. Computational models are also often based on pattern and history,
but it will hurt us more than help us because of our own thinking and actions and because of unpredicted events that may
throw the computational model off.
