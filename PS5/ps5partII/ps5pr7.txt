# Cubic countdown
# 1. ask the user for an input (assume input will be positive and less than 30)
# 2. computes cube of that input (multiple mutiplications)
# 3. prints result
# [[add temporary halt statement to test current version of program]]
# 4. counts downtward from the cube of the input to 0, one integer at a time and prints values
# 5. halt!

02   mul r2 r2 r1     # r2 = r2 * r1 = r1 * r1 * r1
03   write r2         # print the value of cube
