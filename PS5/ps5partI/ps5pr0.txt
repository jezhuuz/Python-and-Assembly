Problem Set 5
Problem 0: Reading and response


1. There is always a constant fear/threat that artificial intelligence and technology will 
outperform and "control" humans and human abilities. However, I don't believe that 
it will ever get to the point where it will surpass the creators. Artificial intelligence
is based off of human habit, convention, and information. For example, Watson did win 
Jeopardy, but it got a lot of questions wrong due to it's "search" method and "knowledge", 
which is just a prebuilt database of information, different from human intelligence and
thinking. I do look forward to, however, the technological advancements in healthcare
and the medical field such as the cure to cancer, however, those advancements would be 
a long time from now and possibly unapproved by the FDA and other walls, which would 
modify/be different from Kurzweil's view of health and life of the future.

2. I remain skeptical about his prediction of 2045 is the year when computers would outperform humans.
His previous preditions were about technological advances that people were working towards
in order to improve human life and health in some way, something that they were purposely 
working towards. As I mentioned before, I am skeptical that computers would 'trump' people 
in a sense. For automotive tasks, yes, computers and robots would definitely have more of an
impact and ease, however, there will always be people who would have to be in charge and
create those computers, give them their tasks, and their aritificial intelligence.
I do not believe that computers will ever hold the same level or kind of intelligence
that humans do, let alone in 15 years (from the article's publish date).
